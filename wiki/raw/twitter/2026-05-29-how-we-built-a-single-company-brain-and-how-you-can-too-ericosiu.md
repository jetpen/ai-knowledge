# How we built a Single Company Brain (and how you can too)

## Body
Your company already has a brain. It's just scattered across Slack, Gong, HubSpot, and someone who's out today.
That's the part people miss when they talk about a company brain. 
The value isn't a giant folder of company knowledge. Every company already has that.
The real advantage is the intelligence layer that sits between all that context and the work your team needs done.
A company brain isn't useful because it remembers more. It's useful when it knows what to retrieve, what to trust, who can see it, and how to turn corrections into better work.
 
We learned this the hard way at Single Grain.  

When we first started building our internal agent fleet, the obvious answer was memory. Give every agent more context. Save the useful notes. Keep the call transcripts. Let the system remember what the humans forget.  

That worked for about three weeks.  Then memory itself became the bottleneck.  

Our persistent memory files started eating about 40% of the context window. Agents had more information, but they weren't always pulling the right information at the right time. 

The system was technically smarter, but operationally much messier.
Here's the 5-layer system we used to fix this:
The broken version:
 
That loop doesn't scale.

The human becomes the router. Every agent output depends on whether someone remembered the right call, copied the right note, pasted the right context, or corrected the same mistake for the fifth time.

So we rebuilt the system around a different idea.

Memory is the raw material. Retrieval is the operating layer.

The working version looks more like this:
 
That one change sounds small, but it changes how the whole company works.

At SG, this is already running across real workflows. We have 500K+ tokens of persistent memory, 90+ daily crons, multiple specialized agents, and thousands of sales calls feeding the system.

One source set included 2,862 Gong call transcripts turned into operational playbooks. In one daily ingestion example, 15 calls produced 390 insights, 470 facts, and 125 frameworks.

That doesn't matter because the number is big. It matters because the system can turn scattered company exhaust into reusable operating intelligence.

A call is no longer just a call. It becomes:

- an objection library
- a sales training input
- a positioning signal
- a content idea source
- a CRM risk flag
- a future agent instruction

A Company Brain should convert knowledge into better execution.

Think about the architecture in five layers.
 
Layer 1: capture
This is where teams usually start, and it's also where they usually stop.

They record meetings. They transcribe calls. They save Slack threads. They dump docs into a vector database. Then they call it a brain.

That's a storage unit, not a brain.

Capture matters because you need raw material. But raw material doesn't make decisions. It doesn't prioritize. It doesn't know which fact is stale, which note is sensitive, or which source should win when two docs disagree.
At Single Grain, capture includes calls, CRM activity, content decisions, internal SOPs, agent outputs, daily logs, and corrections from humans. The point isn't to hoard more information. The point is to make the work surface smarter every week.
 
Layer 2: retrieval
Retrieval is where the system starts becoming useful.

An agent doesn't need the entire history of the company. It needs the 6 pieces of context that matter for the task in front of it.

If it's drafting an outbound email, it needs the ICP, offer, objections, prior campaign performance, brand voice, and current campaign goal.

If it's reviewing pipeline, it needs deal stage changes, stalled accounts, recent call notes, objections, next steps, and what the CRM says now.

If it's writing content, it needs our actual POV, recent performance, approved claims, examples we've already used, and the specific article's proof layer.

This is where a lot of AI systems quietly fail. They look smart in a demo because the context is hand-fed. Then they fall apart in production because nobody built the retrieval layer.
 
Layer 3: source truth
Once your agents can retrieve context, the next problem is trust.

Which source wins?

The sales call? The CRM field? The Slack correction? The old SOP? The newest weekly report? The founder's latest voice note?

If you don't answer that, your agents become confident liars with better formatting.

We had to treat source hierarchy as an operating design problem. Some sources are live truth. Some are historical context. Some are inspiration. Some should never be used in public content. Some can inform a pattern but can't be quoted.

That distinction matters more as the company brain grows.

A good answer from an AI system has to be accurate and source-aware.
 
Layer 4: permissions
Company intelligence gets dangerous when every agent can see everything.

The marketing agent doesn't need private HR details. The content agent doesn't need client financials. The sales agent doesn't need every internal leadership note.

A real Company Brain needs workflow-level permissions. The system should know what a task is allowed to use before it starts generating answers.

This is especially important for agencies and services companies. You have client context, internal context, prospect context, financial context, and strategy context living near each other. If you don't build permission boundaries early, you either leak things or neuter the system until it's useless.

The goal is not one big brain with no walls. The goal is the right brain for the right workflow.
 
Layer 5: feedback loops
This is the layer that makes the system compound.

Every time a human corrects an agent, that correction should become future behavior.

If the agent uses a stiff phrase, the voice rule should update. If it cites an unsafe example, the source rule should update. If it misses a CRM risk signal, the pipeline scan should update. If it routes work to the wrong place, the workflow rule should update.

This is where company intelligence turns into company learning.

Without feedback loops, you're just babysitting software.

With feedback loops, every correction becomes a training rep for the whole operating system.
 
Here's the audit I would run if I were building this inside a company tomorrow:
 
The fastest test is simple.
Pick one recurring workflow that already wastes time. Weekly reporting. Pipeline review. Content drafting. Sales call follow-up. Client onboarding. Proposal creation.

Then ask 6 questions:
1. What sources does this workflow depend on?
2. Which source is the truth when they conflict?
3. What context does the agent need every time?
4. What context should the agent never see?
5. What human corrections happen repeatedly?
6. How does one correction become a future rule?
If you can't answer those, you're not ready to automate the workflow yet. You'll just make the mess faster.

We saw this with reporting.

The old flow was data pulling, manual interpretation, leadership follow-up, and then more clarification. A weekly reporting loop could involve about 25 minutes of data pulling plus hours of follow-up.

Once the brain had the right context, the answer could come back in under 60 seconds.

The time savings are nice. But the bigger win is decision latency.

When a company can ask better questions faster, it starts operating differently. Leaders don't wait for someone to assemble the dashboard. Operators don't start from zero. Agents don't wake up stupid every morning.

This is the actual Single Brain advantage.

It makes the company harder to forget, faster to teach, and easier to operate.
The companies that win with AI won't be the ones with the biggest prompt library. They'll be the ones with the cleanest intelligence layer.
Capture the work.
Retrieve the right context.
Know what to trust.
Protect what shouldn't be used.
Turn every correction into a rule.

That's how the brain compounds.
