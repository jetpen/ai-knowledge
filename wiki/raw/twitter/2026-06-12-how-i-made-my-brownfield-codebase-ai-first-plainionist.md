## Body
Over the last few weeks, I transitioned one of my real codebases so AI agents can work on it much more independently.
My motivation was simple.
I work on many things in parallel, and I never have enough time to implement all the features and improvements I would like to see.
At the same time, I wanted to learn how agentic engineering works in a real brownfield project: with existing architecture, domain rules, tests, and real consequences if something breaks.
This article summarizes what I changed, how the setup evolved, and what I learned so far.
The Codebase
This was not a toy experiment.
The codebase is a real product used for backlog planning and execution support in multi-million-dollar projects. It contains functionality for cut lines, burndowns, projections, and reporting.
The codebase has around 70k lines of code.
The backend is built with F# and ASP.NET. The frontend is built with Vue 3 and Vite. The system uses a microservices and microfrontend architecture, with Clean Architecture internally and shared functionality across the "micro apps".
0. Tests
The existing quality base was already quite good.
Domain rules were explicitly modeled in the F# type system, and the codebase had high test coverage through BDD/Gherkin acceptance specs.
These Gherkin specs now act not only as a safety net for the agents, but also as executable requirement specifications and a source of truth.
I have almost no classic unit tests. Some may see that as a disadvantage, but I see it as an advantage because my tests are very loosely coupled to the product code. And those acceptance tests are fast. Fast enough for agents.
1. Knowledge base
The weak spot was documentation.
I had only limited domain, architecture, and project documentation, which worked well as long as I mostly worked alone in the project. I simply knew the system.
But agents cannot work well independently with implicit knowledge, so the first thing I improved was the documentation.
I created a single `Manual` folder with subfolders for architecture, domain, testing, development, and operations.
Inside, I created separate Markdown files for each section, each usually not bigger than around 200 lines.
The focus is on concepts and background information.
Detailed requirements and behavior remain in the Gherkin `.feature` files, and the documentation points to those files where needed.
I built those documents step by step with Copilot in VS Code: analyzing code and specs, discussing questions, and building up the key documentation step by step.
2. Roles
Once the knowledge base was in better shape, I focused on the team setup.
I knew that it was not only important to provide context, but also to keep it clean. So I decided to use different agents for different roles, focusing on context separation.
I tried different ideas and finally decided on three roles.
The Architect does architecture and requirements engineering. Since the domain and architecture of my project are rather stable, this seemed reasonable. The Architect plans, slices the work, protects the architecture, and performs the final review regarding feature completeness and architecture.
The Implementer changes production code and never changes specs.
The Verifier changes specs and test automation, but never changes production code.
The agent files focus on role descriptions, workflows, contracts, dos, and don'ts.
Especially the Architect has instructions to use sub-agents for detailed analysis to keep its own context clean.
This clear separation between production development and test development resulted in agents controlling each other, which I observed multiple times.
3. Engineering codex
With the roles in place, I turned the Copilot instructions into an engineering codex.
It covers things like:
 size of code changes
code sharing versus coupling
safe refactoring
coding rules for readable code in this project
stop conditions
This became the place for rules that apply to all agents, regardless of their role.
4. SwarmForge
At that point, I wanted my different agents to work together as a team.
When Uncle Bob posted on X about SwarmForge, I knew I wanted to try it. So I installed it and configured it for my setup.
SwarmForge comes with a constitution, project setup, and workflow descriptions explaining how agents communicate, branch, and hand off work - basically describing the team workflow.
5. Handoff rules
With the team workflow in place, I was ready to try my new team on actual features.
It took a while to fix serious gaps in the documentation and harden the handoff gate: which tests to run, what to review, and how to ensure quality.
Eventually, I turned the handoff process into a skill.
6. Skills
Initially, I had no explicit skills.
But as I identified repeated workflow steps, such as regression testing, I asked my team to build skills along the way.
For me, skills became a way to preserve process knowledge, not just project knowledge.
7. Architecture fitness functions
At some point, I noticed that we kept updating the architecture documentation in particular.
That was useful, but it also showed a limitation.
Describing what to do and what not to do is helpful. Automated rules are better.
So I asked the team to write _Architecture Fitness Functions_.
These are realized intentionally as simple scripts, mostly based on regex checks, that detect major architecture violations.
Example rule themes are:
project dependency boundaries
Gherkin file conventions
layering checks
All checks have tests and were fully written by AI. I only reviewed the tests.
This became an important pattern: When implicit knowledge becomes explicit, I first document it. Then I ask whether it can become an automated check.
8. Tools
Once the output quality had become quite stable, I focused on productivity.
Some features still took unexpectedly long.
I tried MCP servers like fff and serena, but they did not make a noticeable difference in my setup.
I discussed this topic with ChatGPT, and it suggested writing repository-specific tools.
The first script was find-entry-points.sh, which makes it easier to find entry points in the codebase for a given topic.
The second was explain-area.sh, which explains the code around a given file.
These scripts were initially written by ChatGPT and later improved by my team based on their usage observations.
Status quo
Meanwhile, I have implemented various features with this setup quite successfully.
My own role has changed. I am now focusing more on writing backlog items that state the goal and what is important to me, and then handing them over to the team.
The Architect often still asks clarification questions, but the team delivers.
I still briefly review everything that ends up on `master`, but no longer every detail.
Instead, I mostly scan for nonsense and violations of the project rules.
For example, just recently the team introduced reflection in a test because it was not explicitly forbidden by the rules.
That was a good example of implicit knowledge.
I had not even thought about documenting it because, to me, it was an obvious no-go.
So I asked the Architect to improve the documentation accordingly and to add an architecture fitness function for it.
I still review generated and modified Gherkin specs carefully, because they are the ultimate quality gate.
Retrospectives
Doing a retrospective with the team after every major piece of work has become a habit.
We ask:
What did we learn?
Which documentation needs updates?
Which new architecture fitness rules are needed?
Did the tools help?
Which skill should be created or improved?
And eventually, we even turned this into a skill.
This way, we improve all artifacts as we go: documentation, rules, skills, tools, and architecture fitness functions.
Main lessons learned
Turning a codebase into an AI-first codebase successfully is less about the AI models themselves than about improving the environment around the agents:
making implicit knowledge explicit
having a strong test safety net, preferably BDD/Gherkin specs
separating agent roles to keep context and responsibilities clean
automating rules as architecture fitness functions
In the end, this became less about one big setup step and more about continuously sharpening the system around the agents.
